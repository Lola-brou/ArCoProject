        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Throughout the process of enriching the ArCo knowledge graph with LLM-assisted ontology enhancements, several challenges emerged. One major obstacle was the sparsity of metadata in the original records—many artifacts, including the Okame mask, were labeled with generic terms like "MASCHERA" without cultural, historical, or functional context. This lack of specificity made it difficult to generate precise enrichments without relying heavily on external research and LLM inference.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Another challenge was ontology alignment. While LLMs could generate plausible RDF triples, many suggested properties (e.g., "folk-theatre-mask" for typology) did not exist in ArCo’s controlled vocabulary. This required manual verification and, in some cases, proposing new URIs to fill semantic gaps. Additionally, multilingual consistency posed difficulties—ensuring that labels and descriptions in Italian and English remained accurate and non-redundant required careful prompt engineering and validation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            One significant challenge was the restricted access to ArCo’s knowledge graph endpoint, which prevented direct implementation of our proposed enrichments. While our generated RDF triples—such as the refined label 
            <em>"Maschera Okame"@it</em> and <em>"Okame Mask"@en</em>—were syntactically valid and semantically justified, 
            their actual integration into ArCo would require approval and manual intervention from the project’s maintainers. This limitation underscored a common hurdle in open knowledge graph projects: balancing collaborative enrichment with governance and data integrity controls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Additionally, ensuring consistent multilingual representation posed difficulties. 
            Early LLM outputs occasionally mixed Italian and English terms 
            (e.g., <em>"Maschera Okame"@en</em> instead of <em>"Okame Mask"@en</em>), 
            which could confuse users querying the knowledge graph. 
            Resolving this required explicit prompt constraints to enforce language-specific annotations 
            (<em>@it</em>, <em>@en</em>) and avoid redundancy between labels and descriptions. This highlighted the need for careful validation when working with multilingual cultural heritage data, where even minor inconsistencies could disrupt interoperability.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Finally, LLM limitations became apparent when generating cultural context and descriptions. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek produced coherent outputs, occasional inaccuracies or overly verbose responses necessitated cross-referencing with authoritative sources (e.g., Museo delle Civiltà records) to ensure correctness. Balancing automation with expert oversight was critical to maintaining the integrity of the enriched data.
